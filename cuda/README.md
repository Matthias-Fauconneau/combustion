To build and run:
```sh
cargo run
```
Requires CUDA and Rust (Cargo) 
```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

- CH4+O2.ron: Chemical data
- main.cu: CUDA version of reaction and transport evaluation
- build.rs: Sets chemical data (CH4+O2) as CUDA constants
- main.rs: Batch reaction evaluation, CUDA version
- main.cpp: Batch reaction evaluation, CUDA version, C++ version (FIXME: update)
- Makefile: Compiles kernel (NVCC, CH4+O2) and C++ app
- model.h: Committed copy of constants generated by build.rs ($CARGO_TARGET_DIR/debug/build/cuda-*/out/model.h)
